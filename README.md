# colour-game
Colour game is an RGB guessing game made to be played in the browser. Colour game is a great way to build an intuition for the rgb colour scheme by practice! At each iteration, a list of 3, or 6 (depending on the chosen difficulty) colours will appear along with an rgb value. Your goal is to try and deduce which colour corresponds with the given rgb value.
